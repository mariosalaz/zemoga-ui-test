## Notes

To develop this project i used a little bit of the each technology that i know:

*HTML
*CSS
*JS
*BOOTSTRAP

Framework
*REACT JS

The only parts of the exercise that i wasn't able to finish was:

* Redirect on main links click: I do this with React Router
* Thumb up/down box next to the name: I do this creating a div and setting its position to absolute and in order to know what kind of thumb is, I check if the person has more likes or dislikes
